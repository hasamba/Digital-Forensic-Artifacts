Project: Automated DFIR Artifact Generation & Timeline Analysis
Overview
This project automates the creation of forensic artifacts from simulated attack scenarios, enabling efficient analysis and timeline reconstruction. As a digital forensics researcher, I am continuously seeking realistic attack data for analysis. This project leverages publicly available DFIR reports to create those scenarios.

The core workflow involves generating attack simulations based on real-world incident reports, capturing forensic artifacts, and processing those artifacts into a consolidated timeline for analysis.

Methodology
Incident Report Acquisition: Incident reports, primarily sourced from The DFIR Report, are used as the basis for attack simulations.

Attack Simulation: ChatGPT is used to generate PowerShell scripts that emulate the attack chains described in the incident reports.

Lab Environment Execution: The generated scripts are executed within a clean, isolated lab environment to ensure controlled artifact generation.

Artifact Acquisition: After script execution, KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor) is used with the SANS Triage Compound configuration to acquire a broad range of relevant artifacts. The output is stored in a ZIP file for portability.

Timeline Generation:

Log2Timeline (Plaso) is used with the KITCHENSINK method to create a comprehensive timeline file (PLASO file) from the acquired artifacts.

The PLASO file is converted to a CSV format for easier manipulation.

Timeline_noise is then used to filter the CSV file, removing common noise and irrelevant events to improve analysis efficiency.
